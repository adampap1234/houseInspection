## Current File

- **Source:** [Poly Haven - Golden Bay](https://polyhaven.com/a/golden_bay)
- **Resolution:** 1K (development — upgrade to 2K/4K for production if needed)

- **Purpose:** Warm afternoon sunlight for PBR material lighting

## Why This HDRI

Golden Bay provides warm, golden-hour sunlight from a low angle, creating the
"afternoon light streaming through windows" effect specified in the design.
The warm tones complement the site's earthy color palette.

## Upgrading Resolution

For sharper reflections on metallic surfaces, download a higher resolution:
- 2K: `https://dl.polyhaven.org/file/ph-assets/HDRIs/hdr/2k/golden_bay_2k.hdr`
- 4K: `https://dl.polyhaven.org/file/ph-assets/HDRIs/hdr/4k/golden_bay_4k.hdr`

Trade-off: larger file = longer loading time. 1K is sufficient for ambient lighting.
